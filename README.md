## PROJECT EXPLANATION
❄️ With the expansion of Internet and technology over the past decade,E-learning has grown exponentially day by day. Cheating in exams has been a widespread phenomenon all over the world regardless of the levels of the technology development.Therefore,detection of traditional cheating methods may no longer be wholly successful to prevent cheating during exams.Online assessment is an integral and vital component of E-learning.Students exams in E-learning are remotely submitted without any monitoring from physical proctors.

❄️ As a result of being able to cheat easily during exams,universities opt for proctoring software’s like METTL,PEGA,EXAMITY etc.They have loads of features.But along with those features , theyhave multiple requirements to be satisfied in order to access them.

❄️ It was reported that the candidate’s passwords were shared with a third party software without the consent of students. Sharing of Aadhar number, bank account details, and phone number has also been reported. This is clearly a security breach and violation of the right to privacy of the aggrieved students.
 

❄️ This was the main reason for the creation of an online monitoring test website, a web-based application which need not be installed,user-friendly and easily accesible by students and organisers.


❄️ So the following operations take place:

        ✨ Candidate Login
           * Instructions Page
           * Monitoring process
           * Exam link retrieval
           * Video link updation
        ✨ Candidate Login
           * Organiser activity page
           * Video link retrieval
           * Exam link updation
